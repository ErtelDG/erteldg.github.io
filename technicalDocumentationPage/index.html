        <p>CSS is the language we use to style a Web page.</p>
        <code></code>
        <li>CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once</li>
        <li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media</li>
        <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets</li>

          CSS syntax
        </header>
        <p>A CSS rule consists of a selector and a declaration block.</p>
        <img src="https://www.w3schools.com/css/img_selector.gif">
        <p>The selector points to the HTML element you want to style.
          The declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons.
          Each declaration includes a CSS property name and a value, separated by a colon.
          Multiple CSS declarations are separated with semicolons, and declaration blocks are surrounded by curly
          braces.</p>
        <h3>Example</h3>
        <p>In this example all elements will be center-aligned, with a red text color:</p>
        <div class="codebox">
          <code>
          p {<br>
          color: red;<br>
          text-align: center;<br>
          }
        </code>
        </div>
        <h3>Example Explained</h3>
        <li>p is a selector in CSS (it points to the HTML element you want to style:
          &ltp&gt).
        </li>
        <li>color is a property, and red is the property value</li>
        <li>text-align is a property, and center is the property value</li>

          The box model
        </header>
        <p>All HTML elements can be considered as boxes.</p>
        <p>In CSS, the term "box model" is used when talking about design and layout.
          The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of: margins, borders,
          padding,
          and the actual content. The image below illustrates the box model:</p>
        <img src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/11243/%3DCSS_Boxmodell_changed.png">
        <p>Explanation of the different parts:</p>
        <li><b>Content</b> - The content of the box, where text and images appear</li>
        <li><b>Padding</b> - Clears an area around the content. The padding is transparent</li>
        <li><b>Border</b> - A border that goes around the padding and content</li>
        <li><b>Margin</b> - Clears an area outside the border. The margin is transparent</li>
        <p>The box model allows us to add a border around elements, and to define space between elements.</p>
        <h3>Example</h3>
        <div class="codebox">
          <code>
            div {<br>
            width: 300px;<br>
            border: 15px solid green;<br>
            padding: 50px;<br>
            margin: 20px;<br>
            }

      <section class="main-section" id="CSS_Position_Property">
        <header>
          CSS Position Property
        </header>
        <p>The position property specifies the type of positioning method used for an element.</p>
        <p>There are five different position values:</p>
        <li>static</li>
        <li>relative</li>
        <li>fixed</li>
        <li>absolute</li>
        <li>sticky</li>
        <p>Elements are then positioned using the top, bottom, left, and right properties. However, these properties
          will not work
          unless the position property is set first. They also work differently depending on the position value.
        </p>
        <h3>Values</h3>
        <h4>static</h4>
        <p>Default value. The element is in normal flow. The properties top, right, bottomor lefthave no effect.</p>
        <h4>relative</h4>
        <p>The element is moved from the normal flow and does not affect other elements as space is left at the original
          position.
          No effect is defined for table-*-group, table-row, table-column, table-cell, and elements. table-caption</p>
        <h4>absolute</h4>
        <p>The element is detached from the normal flow and moved independently. Other elements can be hidden in the
          process. These
          behave as if the element didn't exist and leave no room for the element.
          sticky Experimental</p>
        <h4>sticky</h4>
        <p>A mix between fixedand relative: The element is moved from the normal flow and does not affect other elements
          as long as
          it is inside the viewport. As soon as it is outside, the element is released from the normal flow and remains
          in its
          defined position when scrolling.</p>
        <h4>fixed</h4>
        <p>The shift is based on the viewport. The element is removed from the normal flow and remains in its defined
          position even
          when scrolling. When printed, the item appears in the positioned location on each page .</p>
        <h3>Example</h3>
        <div class="codebox">
          <code>p {font-size:30px; line-height:3em;}<br>
                div.pos {width:49%; text-align:center; border:2px solid #00f;}<br>

        <p>To horizontally center a block element (like
          &ltdiv&gt), use margin: auto;</p>
        <p>Setting the width of the element will prevent it from stretching out to the edges of its container.</p>

        </div>
        <h3>Center Align Text</h3>
        <p>To just center the text inside an element, use text-align: center;</p>
        <h4>Example</h4>
        <div class="codebox">
          <code>
                    .center {<br>

        </div>
        <h3>Center an Image</h3>
        <p>To center an image, set left and right margin to auto and make it into a block element:</p>
        <h4>Example</h4>
        <div class="codebox">

          CSS Flex Container
        </header>
        <h3>The two axes of flexbox</h3>
        <p>When working with flexbox you need to think in terms of two axes — the main axis and the cross axis. The main
          axis is
          defined by the flex-direction property, and the cross axis runs perpendicular to it. Everything we do with
          flexbox
          refers back to these axes, so it is worth understanding how they work from the outset.</p>
        <h3>The main axis</h3>
        <p>The main axis is defined by flex-direction, which has four possible values:</p>
        <li>row</li>
        <li>row-reverse</li>
        <li>column</li>
        <li>column-reverse</li>
        <p>Should you choose row or row-reverse, your main axis will run along the row in the inline direction.</p>
        <img
          src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Flexbox/basics1.png">
        <p>Choose column or column-reverse and your main axis will run from the top of the page to the bottom — in the
          block
          direction.</p>
        <img
          src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Flexbox/basics2.png">
        <h3>The cross axis</h3>
        <p>The cross axis runs perpendicular to the main axis, therefore if your flex-direction (main axis) is set to
          row or
          row-reverse the cross axis runs down the columns.</p>
        <img
          src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Flexbox/basics3.png">
        <p>If your main axis is column or column-reverse then the cross axis runs along the rows.</p>
        <img
          src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Flexbox/basics4.png">
        <h3>Start and end lines</h3>
        <p>Another vital area of understanding is how flexbox makes no assumption about the writing mode of the
          document. In the
          past, CSS was heavily weighted towards horizontal and left-to-right writing modes. Modern layout methods
          encompass the
          range of writing modes and so we no longer assume that a line of text will start at the top left of a document
          and run
          towards the right-hand side, with new lines appearing one under the other.</p>
        <p>You can read more about the relationship between flexbox and the Writing Modes specification in a later
          article;
          however, the following description should help explain why we do not talk about left and right and top and
          bottom when
          we describe the direction that our flex items flow in.</p>
        <p>If the flex-direction is row and I am working in English, then the start edge of the main axis will be on the
          left, the
          end edge on the right.</p>
        <img
          src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Flexbox/basics5.png">
        <code></code>
        <p>If I were to work in Arabic, then the start edge of my main axis would be on the right and the end edge on
          the left.</p>
        <img
          src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Flexbox/basics6.png">
        <p>In both cases the start edge of the cross axis is at the top of the flex container and the end edge at the
          bottom, as
          both languages have a horizontal writing mode.</p>
        <p>After a while, thinking about start and end rather than left and right becomes natural, and will be useful to
          you when
          dealing with other layout methods such as CSS Grid Layout which follow the same patterns.</p>

        <header>
          CSS Properties Flex Items
        </header>
        <h3>Properties applied to flex items</h3>
        <p>To have more control over flex items we can target them directly. We do this by way of three properties:</p>
        <li>flex-grow</li>
        <li>flex-shrink</li>
        <li>flex-basis</li>
        <p>We will take a brief look at these properties in this overview, and you can gain a fuller understanding in
          the guide
          Controlling Ratios of Flex Items on the Main Axis.</p>
        <p>Before we can make sense of these properties we need to consider the concept of available space. What we are
          doing when
          we change the value of these flex properties is to change the way that available space is distributed amongst
          our items.
          This concept of available space is also important when we come to look at aligning items.</p>
        <p>If we have three 100 pixel-wide items in a container which is 500 pixels wide, then the space we need to lay
          out our
          items is 300 pixels. This leaves 200 pixels of available space. If we don't change the initial values then
          flexbox will
          put that space after the last item.</p>
        <img
          src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Flexbox/basics7.png">
        <p>If we instead would like the items to grow and fill the space, then we need to have a method of distributing
          the
          leftover space between the items. This is what the flex properties that we apply to the items themselves, will
          do.</p>

        <h3>The flex-basis property</h3>
        <p>The flex-basis is what defines the size of that item in terms of the space it leaves as available space. The
          initial
          value of this property is auto — in this case the browser looks to see if the items have a size. In the
          example above,
          all of the items have a width of 100 pixels and so this is used as the flex-basis.</p>
        <p>If the items don't have a size then the content's size is used as the flex-basis. This is why when we just
          declare
          display: flex on the parent to create flex items, the items all move into a row and take only as much space as
          they need
          to display their contents.</p>
        <h3>The flex-grow property</h3>
        <p>With the flex-grow property set to a positive integer, flex items can grow along the main axis from their
          flex-basis.
          This will cause the item to stretch and take up any available space on that axis, or a proportion of the
          available space
          if other items are allowed to grow too.</p>
        <p>If we gave all of our items in the example above a flex-grow value of 1 then the available space in the flex
          container
          would be equally shared between our items and they would stretch to fill the container on the main axis.</p>
        <p>The flex-grow property can be used to distribute space in proportion. If we give our first item a flex-grow
          value of 2,
          and the other items a value of 1 each, 2 parts of the available space will be given to the first item (100px
          out of
          200px in the case of the example above), 1 part each the other two (50px each out of the 200px total).</p>
        <h3>The flex-shrink property</h3>
        <p>Where the flex-grow property deals with adding space in the main axis, the flex-shrink property controls how
          it is taken
          away. If we do not have enough space in the container to lay out our items, and flex-shrink is set to a
          positive
          integer, then the item can become smaller than the flex-basis. As with flex-grow, different values can be
          assigned in
          order to cause one item to shrink faster than others — an item with a higher value set for flex-shrink will
          shrink
          faster than its siblings that have lower values.</p>
        <p>The minimum size of the item will be taken into account while working out the actual amount of shrinkage that
          will
          happen, which means that flex-shrink has the potential to appear less consistent than flex-grow in behavior.
          We'll
          therefore take a more detailed look at how this algorithm works in the article Controlling Ratios of items
          along the
          main axis.</p>
        <h3>Shorthand values for the flex properties</h3>
        <p>You will very rarely see the flex-grow, flex-shrink, and flex-basis properties used individually; instead
          they are
          combined into the flex shorthand. The flex shorthand allows you to set the three values in this order —
          flex-grow,
          flex-shrink, flex-basis.</p>
        <p>The live example below allows you to test out the different values of the flex shorthand; remember that the
          first value
          is flex-grow. Giving this a positive value means the item can grow. The second is flex-shrink — with a
          positive value
          the items can shrink, but only if their total values overflow the main axis. The final value is flex-basis;
          this is the
          value the items are using as their base value to grow and shrink from.</p>
