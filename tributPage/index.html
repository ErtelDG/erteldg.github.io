      <ul class="historytable">
        <li><strong>1991</strong> - The Linux kernel is publicly announced on 25 August by the 21-year-old Finnish
          student Linus Benedict Torvalds</li>
        <li>
          <strong>1992</strong> - The Linux kernel is relicensed under the GNU GPL. The first Linux distributions are
          created.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1993</strong> - Over 100 developers work on the Linux kernel. With their assistance the kernel is
          adapted to the GNU environment, which
          creates a large spectrum of application types for Linux. The oldest currently existing Linux distribution,
          Slackware, is
          released for the first time. Later in the same year, the Debian project is established. Today it is the
          largest
          community distribution.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1994</strong> - Torvalds judges all components of the kernel to be fully matured: he releases
          version 1.0 of Linux. The XFree86 project
          contributes a graphical user interface (GUI). Commercial Linux distribution makers Red Hat and SUSE publish
          version 1.0
          of their Linux distributions.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1995</strong> - Linux is ported to the DEC Alpha and to the Sun SPARC. Over the following years it
          is ported to an ever-greater number
          of platforms.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1996</strong> - Version 2.0 of the Linux kernel is released. The kernel can now serve several
          processors at the same time using
          symmetric multiprocessing (SMP), and thereby becomes a serious alternative for many companies.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1998</strong> - Many major companies such as IBM, Compaq and Oracle announce their support for
          Linux. The Cathedral and the Bazaar is
          first published as an essay (later as a book), resulting in Netscape publicly releasing the source code to
          its Netscape
          Communicator web browser suite. Netscape's actions and crediting of the essay[63] brings Linux's open source
          development
          model to the attention of the popular technical press. In addition a group of programmers begins developing
          the
          graphical user interface KDE. Linux first appears on the Top500 list of fastest supercomputers.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1999</strong> - A group of developers begin work on the graphical environment GNOME, destined to
          become a free replacement for KDE,
          which at the time, depended on the then proprietary Qt toolkit. During the year IBM announces an extensive
          project for
          the support of Linux. Version 2.2 of the Linux kernel is released.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>2000</strong> - Dell announces that it is now the No. 2 provider of Linux-based systems worldwide
          and the first major manufacturer to
          offer Linux across its full product line.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>2001</strong> - Version 2.4 of the Linux kernel is released.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>2002</strong> - The media reports that "Microsoft killed Dell Linux"
        </li>
        <li><strong>2003</strong> - Version 2.6 of the Linux kernel is released.</li>
        <li>
          <strong>2004</strong> - The XFree86 team splits up and joins with the existing X standards body to form the
          X.Org Foundation, which results in a
          substantially faster development of the X server for Linux.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>2005</strong> - The project openSUSE begins a free distribution from Novell's community. Also the
          project OpenOffice.org introduces
          version 2.0 that then started supporting OASIS OpenDocument standards.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>2006</strong> - Oracle releases its own distribution of Red Hat Enterprise Linux. Novell and
          Microsoft announce cooperation for a better
          interoperability and mutual patent protection.
        </li>
        <li><strong>2007</strong> - Dell starts distributing laptops with Ubuntu pre-installed on them</li>
        <li><strong>2009</strong> - Red Hat's market capitalization equals Sun's, interpreted as a symbolic moment for
          the "Linux-based economy"</li>
        <li><strong>2011</strong> - Version 3.0 of the Linux kernel is released.</li>
        <li><strong>2012</strong> - The aggregate Linux server market revenue exceeds that of the rest of the Unix
          market.</li>
        <li><strong>2013</strong> - Google's Linux-based Android claims 75% of the smartphone market share, in terms
          of the number of phones shipped.</li>
        <li><strong>2014</strong> - Ubuntu claims 22,000,000 users.</li>
        <li><strong>2015</strong> - Version 4.0 of the Linux kernel is released.[</li>
        <li><strong>2017</strong> - All of Top500 list of fastest supercomputers run Linux.</li>
        <li><strong>2019</strong> - Version 5.0 of the Linux kernel is released.[</li>
