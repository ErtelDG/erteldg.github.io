          The Magic 8 Ball is a plastic sphere, made to look like an oversized
          eight ball, that is used for fortune-telling or seeking advice. It was
          invented in 1946 by Albert C. Carter and Abe Bookman and is currently
          manufactured by Mattel. The user asks a yesâ€“no question to the ball,
          then turns it over to reveal an answer in a window on the ball.

          The functional component of the Magic 8 Ball was invented by Albert C.
          Carter, who was inspired by a spirit writing device used by his mother
          Mary, a Cincinnati clairvoyant. When Carter approached store owner Max
          Levinson about stocking the device, Levinson called in Abe Bookman,
          Levinson's brother-in-law, and graduate of Ohio Mechanics Institute.
          In 1944, Carter filed for a patent for the cylindrical device,
          assigning it in 1946 to Bookman, Levinson and another partner in what
          came to be Alabe Crafts, Inc., combining the founder's names, Albert
          and Abe. Alabe marketed and sold the cylinder as The Syco-Slate.
          Carter died sometime before the patent was granted in 1948. Bookman
          made improvements to The Syco-Slate, and in 1948 it was encased in an
          iridescent crystal ball. Though not successful, the revamped product
          caught the attention of Chicago's Brunswick Billiards, who in 1950
          commissioned Alabe Crafts to make a version in the form of a
          traditional black-and-white 8 ball, which was possibly inspired by a
          gag in the 1940 Three Stooges short film, You Nazty Spy!.
